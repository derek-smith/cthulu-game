TODO:
- Build overlay for image
  + Tie to number of guesses in state
    - The lower the number to reveal the image the harder the difficulty
      + To implement this you'd need to implement difficulties

- Display and incorporate guess count
  + Currently silently tracking number of guesses user makes, but not doing anything with that info or even showing it

- Disable letter buttons that have been clicked

- End game features
  + Once defaultDisplay is devoid of *'s display a pop up message with the new game button

- Write a proper readme file

- Cleanup remaining css files
