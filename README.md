## Cthuluman

Welcome to hacktober 2020! 

This year is just as dark as this game you've found. Cthuluman is a take on the classic hangman game you played before we all had tiny computers in our pockets. Guess letters until you have filled out the blank spaces below the spooky picture of Cthullu. Credit to [ANDRÉE WALLIN](https://andreewallin.com/Misc-Client-Work) for the picture which I will remove the second he asks.

This version of the game is imperfect on purpose to provide you all the opportunity to fix broken code, challenge design decisions, and go where many devs have gone before, but maybe you haven't yet. You'll find a number of tasks outlined in the repo needing someone to take them on, but I will also be accepting things that aren't listed under [Issues](https://github.com/pepper-seattle/cthulu-game/issues).

### PR Submission

If you are taking on one of the tasks or making your own unique PRs please keep the following in mind:

- There is no offensive language or imagery allowed
- Code has been well tested by you prior to submission
  - Hint: now is a good time to practice unit testing!
- Your last commit should include your name added to the contributors file

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
